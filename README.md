Brute Force attack on telegram

# Introduction
The Telegram (android) application can be protected with a passcode. This passcode is a 4 digit code.

This script allows one to bruteforce this passcode.

# Operating mode
The passcode is saved in a hashed form in a XML-file (see below). The hash method is sha256. The hash is double salted: the same salt is placed before AND after the passcode. The passcode part is the string UTF-8 representation of the 4 digits

# Configuration file
The file "shared_prefs/userconfig.xml" contains something like this :
# 
    <map>
     [...]
     <string name="passcodeHash1">*** SHA256 HASH***</string>
     [...]
     <string name="passcodeSalt">*** BASE64 SALT ***</string>
     [...]
    </map>

You must take the "passcodeSalt" and "passcodeHash1" values to run this script

# Usage
    Telegrambruteforce.py --salt the base64 salt --hash the hash
